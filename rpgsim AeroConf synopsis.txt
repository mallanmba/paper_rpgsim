When planning planetary rover missions it is useful to develop intuition and skills driving in, quite literally, alien environments before incurring the cost of reaching said locales.  Simulators make it possible to operate in environments that have the physical characteristics of target locations without the expense and overhead of extensive physical tests.  To that end, NASA Ames and Open Robotics collaborated on a Lunar rover driving simulator based on the open source Gazebo simulation platform and leveraging ROS (Robotic Operating System) components.  The simulator was integrated with research and mission software for rover driving, system monitoring, and science instrument simulation to constitute an end-to-end Lunar mission simulation capability.

This presentation introduces the Resource Prospector (RP) Driving ConOps Simulator, an end-to-end simulation used to develop and refine the RP concept of operations.
