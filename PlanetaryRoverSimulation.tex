\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


- Resource Prospector Background
  - High level overview of mission objectives
  - Differences to Mars ops
  - High level concept of operations
  - High level software architecture
    - flight/ground software split
- Simulator goals / overview
  - Development approach
    - create driving sim as fast as possible
      - development/refinement of conops
    - prototype mission software architecture with stubs and existing components
    - use sim-generated data for flight software development
      - flight software -> Gazebo
      - Gazebo & ROS output -> nav & localization
    - incrementatlly replace stubs and emulated components with flight versions
    - use for training
- Synthetic Terrain Generation
- Lunar Visual Environment
  - Gazebo terrain enhancements
    - LOD
    - backround tiles
  - Shadows
    - real time shadow challenges 
    - baked shadows
    - Gazebo shadow improvements
  - GLSL shader
  - Wheel tracks
  - Ephemeris
  - HDR
    - Earthshine, bounced light
    - high bit depth rendering in Gazebo
    - PBR indirect lighting experiment 
    - attempt to reproduce in GLSL 
- Vehicle simulation
  - Use existing, similar robots to emulate 
    - Husky
    - KRex2
  - Flight software integration with Gazebo
  - Wheel slip plugin
    - first order approximation
    - fault injection
- Flight Software Prototype
  - flight/ground split
  - emulation with ROS components
  - Ops software
    - WARP
    - VERVE
  - Science sim and software
- Driving ConOps Experiments
- Results
  - visual odometry
  - lunar illumination comparison 
  - wheel slip results
